Done:
1. Python implementation for Typing from Data's shape inference algorithm
2. Python class generation from shapes
3. Constraints wrapper in Python with z3 backend.

TODO:
1. Shape inference based on the "type" of each component
2. Constraint checking - given the set of constraints, check if a config is valid
   1. Do we have to take care of missing optional values?
3. Constraint generation
